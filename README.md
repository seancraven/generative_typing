# Type-RS
Type-RS is a small command line tool that lets you do typing practice from the command line. This is the basic foundation for a larger project which uses a generative model, to help increase typing speed with code.

In the current state you can run main rs with a file as an argument, and the program will allow you to practice your typing.

This base branch includes the basic version of the typing command line tool.
